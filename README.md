# 🖙️ Weyoto Voice — AI-Powered Text-to-Speech Generator (Flask + OpenAI)

**Weyoto Voice** is a modular Flask application that turns text into high-quality, realistic speech using OpenAI’s `gpt-4o-mini-tts` model. Users can customize tone using natural language instructions and generate downloadable MP3s in seconds — no microphone, no editing.

Built with a clean monolithic structure (no database), this is a perfect starter project or production-ready base for voice automation, storytelling tools, or creative audio projects.
